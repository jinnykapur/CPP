Backtracking:
It's a problem solving algorithm which uses a brute-force approach for
finding desired output.

It's like trying different paths, and when you hit the dead end, you back track to the 
last choice and try a different route.

Decision Space:
It's a set of all possible choice at each decision point.

Basic Terminologies
Candidate: A candidate is a potential choice or element that can be added
to the current solution.
Solution: The solution is a valid and complete configuration that satisfies
all problem constraints.
Partial Solution: A partial solution is an intermediate or incomplete 
configuration being constructed during the backtracking process.
Decision Space: The decision space is the set of all possible candidates 
or choices at each decision point.
Decision Point: A decision point is a specific step in the algorithm 
where a candidate is chosen and added to the partial solution.
Feasible Solution: A feasible solution is a partial or complete solution 
that adheres to all constraints.
Dead End: A dead end occurs when a partial solution cannot be extended without 
violating constraints.
Backtrack: Backtracking involves undoing previous decisions and returning to 
a prior decision point.
Search Space: The search space includes all possible combinations of candidates 
and choices.
Optimal Solution: In optimization problems, the optimal solution is the best 
possible solution.
